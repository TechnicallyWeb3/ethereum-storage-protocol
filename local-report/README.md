# ESP Local Deployment - Analysis and Recommendations

This folder contains the analysis and recommendations for improving the local deployment functionality in the ethereum-storage-protocol library.

## Files in this Folder

- `summary.md` - Executive summary of findings and recommendations
- `report.md` - Comprehensive report on the current implementation and recommendations
- `current-implementation.md` - Detailed analysis of the current implementation
- `implementation-tasks.md` - Specific tasks for implementing the recommendations
- `test-cases.js` - Test cases for the proposed improvements
- `proposed-implementation.js` - Proposed implementation for the improvements
- `test-cli.js` - Simple test script for the current CLI functionality

## Key Findings

The current implementation of the local deployment functionality has several issues:

1. It modifies the source files directly, which is not ideal
2. It doesn't provide a streamlined way to deploy and register contracts
3. It lacks flexibility in how contracts can be deployed

## Key Recommendations

1. Create a separate storage mechanism for local deployments
2. Create a unified deployment command for Hardhat users
3. Implement a flexible deployment API
4. Update documentation to be consistent

## Next Steps

1. Review the recommendations and decide which ones to implement
2. Prioritize the implementation tasks
3. Assign tasks for implementation
4. Create a timeline for completion

## Testing

The test-cli.js file demonstrates the current functionality. To run it:

```bash
cd /workspace/test-esp-deployment
node test-cli.js
```

This will install the ethereum-storage package from the local directory and test the add-localhost command.
