# ESP Local Deployment - Summary of Findings

## Key Issues

1. **Source File Modification**: 
   - The current implementation modifies the `esp.deployments.ts/js` source file directly
   - This approach is problematic as it changes files that should only contain official deployments

2. **Node Modules Targeting**: 
   - The implementation should only modify the installed instance in node_modules
   - Currently, it modifies both the source files and the installed package

3. **Deployment Workflow**:
   - Users need to manually deploy contracts and then register them separately
   - No streamlined way to deploy with Hardhat Runtime Environment (hre) or custom provider

## Key Recommendations

1. **Separate Local Deployments Storage**:
   - Create a separate file for storing local deployments (e.g., `~/.esp/local.deployments.json`)
   - Modify the `getContractAddress` function to check both official and local deployments

2. **Unified Deployment Command**:
   - Create a Hardhat task that combines deployment and registration in one step
   - Example: `npx hardhat esp:deploy-local --royalty 0.1 --owner 0x123...`

3. **Flexible Deployment API**:
   - Create a utility function that accepts hre or provider for deploying contracts
   - Implement sensible defaults for all deployment parameters

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**:
   - Fix the file modification issue by creating a separate storage mechanism
   - Update the `getContractAddress` function to check both official and local deployments

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Create a unified deployment command for Hardhat users
   - Implement the flexible deployment API

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Update documentation and improve default values
   - Add more comprehensive test cases

## Files Created for Review

1. `report.md` - Comprehensive report on the current implementation and recommendations
2. `test-cases.js` - Test cases for the proposed improvements
3. `proposed-implementation.js` - Proposed implementation for the improvements
4. `test-cli.js` - Simple test script for the current CLI functionality

## Next Steps

1. Decide which recommendations to implement
2. Prioritize the implementation tasks
3. Assign tasks for implementation
4. Create a timeline for completion
