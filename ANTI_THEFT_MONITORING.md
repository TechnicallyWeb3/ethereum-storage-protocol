# ESP Anti-Theft Monitoring Guide

## Automated Monitoring

### 1. GitHub Code Search
Search for these unique identifiers monthly:
```
"ESP_FINGERPRINT_TW3_2025_DPS_v2"
"ESP_FINGERPRINT_TW3_2025_DPR_v2"
"calculateDataPointAddress"
"DataPointRoyalty"
```

### 2. Google Alerts
Set up alerts for:
- "DataPointStorage" + "royalty"
- "ESP" + "ethereum storage protocol"
- "gas-based royalty" + "blockchain"

### 3. Blockchain Explorers
Monitor for deployed contracts containing your bytecode:
- Etherscan contract verification
- Sourcify database
- Tenderly contract database

## Legal Action Steps

### If You Find Theft:

1. **Document Everything**
   - Screenshot the infringing code
   - Archive the repository (archive.org)
   - Note publication dates
   - Compare against your TIMESTAMP.md

2. **AGPL-3.0 Violation Notice**
   ```
   Subject: AGPL-3.0 License Violation - ESP Code Usage
   
   Dear [Violator],
   
   Your project [PROJECT] contains code derived from our Ethereum Storage 
   Protocol (ESP) published under AGPL-3.0 license on [DATE].
   
   Required compliance:
   - Add copyright notice crediting TechnicallyWeb3
   - Release your modifications under AGPL-3.0
   - Provide source code access for network services
   
   Failure to comply within 30 days will result in legal action.
   ```

3. **DMCA Takedown** (if they don't comply)
   - File with GitHub, GitLab, etc.
   - Reference your publication timestamp
   - Cite copyright infringement

4. **Legal Action**
   - Copyright infringement lawsuit
   - AGPL-3.0 license violation
   - Damages for commercial use

## Red Flags to Watch For

- ❌ Similar algorithm with renamed variables
- ❌ "Inspired by" without proper attribution  
- ❌ Closed-source commercial products using your logic
- ❌ ICOs/tokens claiming your innovations
- ❌ Academic papers without citing your work

## Your Evidence Arsenal

1. **Git commit history** - Shows development timeline
2. **NPM publication** - Public timestamp
3. **GitHub repository** - Community verification
4. **TIMESTAMP.md** - Legal proof document
5. **Test suite** - Proves deep understanding
6. **Documentation** - Shows original thought process

**Remember**: AGPL-3.0 is one of the strongest licenses against theft. Use it!
